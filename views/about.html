            Hi, I am Marcus Brown, a student currently studying at Seneca
            Polytechnic for Computer Programming, though I have previously
            completed a 4 year Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Marketing from
            Toronto Metropolitan Univeristy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite my degree from TMU which would give me many job prospects, I
            decided to pursue Computer Programming because I knew I would regret
            it if I didn't pursue something which I am passionate about.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began learning to code in the summer before my first semester at
            Seneca. At first, I created simple projects like to-do lists and
            static page websites until I eventually learned about React.js. In
            order to learn React I decided it was time to start a bigger
            project. This is when I created my Training-Log App which made me
            struggle and learn a ton. My App enables users to track their
            workout without overcomplicating things as most of the currently
            available apps do. The App also supports exporting files to a csv
            for backup. Once I finish with all the features of this App I plan
            on creating a Library App for me and my friends to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for hobbies and interests of mine aside from coding, you may
            already have guessed, but I am very passionate about Powerlifting, I
            love to read every day, occasionally I will cook an extravagent
            meal, and of course having a good time with friends.
